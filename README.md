The demo files found in [Sarah Drasner's Night Owl](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl&WT.mc_id=twitter-social-sdras) and [Wes Bos's Cobalt2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wesbos.theme-cobalt2&WT.mc_id=github-theme-sdras) themes were particularly useful in the development and testing of this theme.

The Schwifty color palette was inspired by my unhealthy obsession with Adult Swim's [Rick and Morty](https://www.rickandmorty.com/).
